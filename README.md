## Electric solid propellants START-CONTROL-STOP-REPEAT

"Electric solid propellants (ESPs) are a family of high performance plastisol solid propellants that can be ignited and throttled by the application of electric current. Unlike conventional rocket motor propellants that are difficult to control and extinguish, ESPs can be ignited reliably at precise intervals and durations. It requires no moving parts and the propellant is insensitive to flames or electrical sparks.[wiki 36]"

"In this research project, the focus was on developing high-performance families of solid propellants that are capable of being used in Insensitive Munitions (IM) and are easy to manufacture using environmentally-friendly processes and ingredients. The researchers created "igniterless" electric solid propellant (ESP) rocket motors that use inert metal electrodes for ignition rather than pyrotechnic systems. These motors were demonstrated at a 1-inch diameter scale and showed good performance in fast cook-off Insensitive Munitions tests. The researchers also conducted static tests of 200 lbf thrust class ESP motors that were ignited using an electrical initiation system without pyrotechnics. In addition, the researchers developed formulations for minimum signature propellants and reduced-signature propellants that contain boron, which are undergoing qualification testing for potential use in defense and commercial applications."

Electric solid propellants (ESPs) are a promising option for use in high-temperature environments because of their stability under such conditions. However, the chemistry of ESPs can change at high temperatures, which can affect their performance and safety. By using a computer model to simulate the thermochemistry of ESPs at high temperatures, researchers were able to predict how the chemistry of the solid propellant changes as it is vaporized. They found that the high-performance ESP has a higher enthalpy at high temperatures compared to traditional Teflon material, which could lead to "frozen flow losses" where energy is stored internally in the gas instead of being used to accelerate it and generate thrust. This understanding could help improve the performance and efficiency of ESPs in high-temperature environments like ablation pulsed plasma thrusters, as well as potentially other solid propellant applications such as pyrotechnics or laser ablation.

## ESP chemistry
Hydroxylammonium nitrate (HAN) is an inorganic compound that is a salt derived from hydroxylamine and nitric acid. It is a hygroscopic solid, which means it absorbs moisture from the air. HAN is unstable due to the presence of both a reducing agent (the hydroxylammonium cation) and an oxidizer (the nitrate anion). This makes it similar to ammonium nitrate, which is also unstable. HAN is usually handled as an aqueous solution, which is corrosive, toxic, and potentially carcinogenic. Solid HAN is also unstable, especially in the presence of metal salts.

HAN has the potential to be used as a rocket propellant, either in monopropellant or bipropellant form. It has been suggested that HAN-based propellants could be a good choice for "green" rocket missions, as they offer 50% higher performance for a given propellant tank compared to hydrazine, a commonly used rocket propellant.

Best is HIPEP = HAN + Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVOH, PVA, or PVAl) made by DSSB in Reno USA.

The production of electric solid propellants (ESPs) is likely to be a specialized process that requires specific equipment and expertise. To make ESPs, the ingredients (hydroxyl ammonium nitrate and polyvinyl alcohol) are first weighed and mixed together in the appropriate ratio to form a plastisol. The mixture is then shaped and cured into the desired form, which could be a solid block, a granulated powder, or some other shape depending on the intended use.

The exact process for shaping and curing the ESP will depend on the specific formulation and the equipment being used. For example, the mixture may be pressed into a mold, extruded through a die, or poured into a tray to set. Once the ESP has been shaped and cured, it is ready for use as a rocket propellant.

It is worth noting that the production of ESPs is likely to be a complex and specialized process that requires specific equipment and expertise. The materials required to make ESPs are also not widely available and may require an ATF (Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms) license to purchase. There is only one company in the world that produces ESPs, called DSSB, based in Reno. As such, it is not something that can be easily done by the average individual. For now.
