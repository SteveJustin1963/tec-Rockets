## Electric solid propellants
"Electric solid propellants (ESPs) are a family of high performance plastisol solid propellants that can be ignited and throttled by the application of electric current. Unlike conventional rocket motor propellants that are difficult to control and extinguish, ESPs can be ignited reliably at precise intervals and durations. It requires no moving parts and the propellant is insensitive to flames or electrical sparks.[wiki 36]"

"In this research project, the focus was on developing high-performance families of solid propellants that are capable of being used in Insensitive Munitions (IM) and are easy to manufacture using environmentally-friendly processes and ingredients. The researchers created "igniterless" electric solid propellant (ESP) rocket motors that use inert metal electrodes for ignition rather than pyrotechnic systems. These motors were demonstrated at a 1-inch diameter scale and showed good performance in fast cook-off Insensitive Munitions tests. The researchers also conducted static tests of 200 lbf thrust class ESP motors that were ignited using an electrical initiation system without pyrotechnics. In addition, the researchers developed formulations for minimum signature propellants and reduced-signature propellants that contain boron, which are undergoing qualification testing for potential use in defense and commercial applications."

One of the major benefits of electric solid propellant (ESP) is its ability to be ignited using an electrical current rather than pyrotechnic ignition systems. This direct ignition method simplifies the propulsion system and increases safety.
