Here are some simple rocketry-related experiments that can be integrated with an TEC-1 SBC Z80 for control, measurement, and monitoring:

### 1. **Ignition Control**
   - **Goal**: Control and monitor ignition of small electric solid propellant (ESP) charges.
   - **Setup**:
     - Use the Z80 SBC to send ignition signals to a relay or MOSFET that controls current to the propellant.
     - Monitor ignition success with a feedback circuit, such as a photodiode or thermistor.
   - **Measurement**:
     - Measure the current and voltage supplied during ignition to evaluate efficiency.
     - Use an ADC to capture sensor feedback and display ignition status on a 7-segment display.
   - **Enhancements**: Add safety interlocks or countdown features in software.

### 2. **Thrust Measurement**
   - **Goal**: Measure and log the thrust generated by a small rocket motor.
   - **Setup**:
     - Build a simple load cell or use a force sensor.
     - Connect the sensor output to an ADC and read the data with the Z80 SBC.
   - **Control**:
     - Use the SBC to start and stop the thrust test based on user input or a preset time.
   - **Measurement**:
     - Display thrust in real-time on a connected display or log data to an external memory module.

### 3. **Temperature Monitoring**
   - **Goal**: Monitor the temperature near the propellant or engine during operation.
   - **Setup**:
     - Use a thermocouple or thermistor for temperature sensing.
     - Interface the temperature sensor with the Z80 using an ADC.
   - **Control**:
     - Trigger alerts or shutdown commands if the temperature exceeds safe limits.
   - **Measurement**:
     - Plot temperature data over time for analysis.

### 4. **Fuel Burn Rate Analysis**
   - **Goal**: Measure the burn rate of a propellant sample.
   - **Setup**:
     - Use a light gate or optical sensor to detect the propellant's burn progress.
     - Send data to the Z80 for timing and logging.
   - **Control**:
     - Automate ignition and termination based on burn progress.
   - **Measurement**:
     - Calculate the burn rate by dividing the consumed propellant length by the elapsed time.

### 5. **Altitude and Acceleration Measurement**
   - **Goal**: Measure the altitude and acceleration of a model rocket.
   - **Setup**:
     - Use an altimeter module (e.g., BMP180) and an accelerometer (e.g., ADXL345).
     - Connect the sensors via an I2C or SPI interface to the Z80.
   - **Control**:
     - Log sensor data only during flight to conserve memory.
   - **Measurement**:
     - Display peak altitude and acceleration post-flight.

### 6. **Servo-Controlled Fins**
   - **Goal**: Experiment with active flight stabilization.
   - **Setup**:
     - Use the Z80 to control servos that adjust the rocket’s fins.
     - Use an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) for real-time orientation feedback.
   - **Control**:
     - Implement basic PID control to stabilize the rocket during ascent.
   - **Measurement**:
     - Record servo movements and IMU data to evaluate performance.

### 7. **Telemetry System**
   - **Goal**: Transmit data wirelessly during flight.
   - **Setup**:
     - Use a LoRa or 433 MHz module to send telemetry data (altitude, temperature, thrust).
     - Program the Z80 to pack and transmit data at regular intervals.
   - **Control**:
     - Add a system reset if communication is lost.
   - **Measurement**:
     - Receive and log data on a ground station.

### 8. **Timing Experiments**
   - **Goal**: Test the timing accuracy of ignition sequences.
   - **Setup**:
     - Program the Z80 to ignite multiple stages or charges at predefined intervals.
     - Use an oscilloscope or a secondary timer circuit to verify timing accuracy.
   - **Control**:
     - Adjust timing dynamically based on sensor feedback.
   - **Measurement**:
     - Record discrepancies in timing for analysis.

### 9. **Exhaust Gas Analysis**
   - **Goal**: Measure the composition or temperature of exhaust gases.
   - **Setup**:
     - Use a gas sensor module for specific components (e.g., CO2, NOx).
     - Interface the sensor with the Z80 for real-time analysis.
   - **Control**:
     - Trigger alerts if gas concentrations exceed safe limits.
   - **Measurement**:
     - Log gas concentration data over time for post-test evaluation.

### 10. **Rocket Position Tracking**
   - **Goal**: Track the position of the rocket post-flight.
   - **Setup**:
     - Use a GPS module interfaced with the Z80.
   - **Control**:
     - Trigger GPS logging only during flight to conserve power.
   - **Measurement**:
     - Display the rocket’s final location on a connected display.

These experiments provide a foundation for integrating the Z80 SBC into rocketry projects, leveraging its ability to process inputs and control outputs in real-time.
